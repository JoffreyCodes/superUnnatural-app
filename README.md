## General Info

### Backstory:

Supernatural is a VR game that promotes exercise through music. Each workout is a playlist of today's modern and yesterday's classical songs that are not only an enjoyable experience to "flow" or "box" to, but also serve to expose users to new or once-familiar music. The Supernatural app provides a feed of the user's workout history, along with access to the Spotify Playlist. However, navigating the Supernatural app for each song that you enjoy is a lenghty process, especially when having to navigate back and forth between Spotify and Supernatural to preview each song. I decided to build this app to expidite this process so that I can preview the songs to help me recall which songs I enjoyed, and save them onto a Spotify playlist for enjoying at a later time, likely during car rides.

SuperUnnatural is a single-page application that allows users to save, play, and preview workout songs that were recently played on Supernatural onto their Spotify "Liked" playlist.
